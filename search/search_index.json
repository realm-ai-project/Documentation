While the RL Subsystem can be used completely independently of other subsystems, the recommended use of this subsystem is to be used in conjunction with the rest of the subsystems. Overview of the RL Subsystem The RL Subsystem is made of two components: the Training Manager , and Unity's ML-Agents Python package , which is part of the ML-Agents Toolkit . ML-Agents Python Package Built by Unity , the ML-Agents Python package contains implementations of several commonly used RL algorithms, and allows agents of these algorithms to interact with the game. Training Manager Since one of the main goals of this project is to ensure that game developers can use the tool without requiring extensive knowledge in RL, the training manager is meant to further simplify the process of using the underlying ML-Agents Python package. This includes the feature of hyperparameter tuning , which allows users to use the RL algorithms without the need to manually select the hyperparameters.","title":"Description"},{"location":"rl_subsystem/description/#overview-of-the-rl-subsystem","text":"The RL Subsystem is made of two components: the Training Manager , and Unity's ML-Agents Python package , which is part of the ML-Agents Toolkit .","title":"Overview of the RL Subsystem"},{"location":"rl_subsystem/description/#ml-agents-python-package","text":"Built by Unity , the ML-Agents Python package contains implementations of several commonly used RL algorithms, and allows agents of these algorithms to interact with the game.","title":"ML-Agents Python Package"},{"location":"rl_subsystem/description/#training-manager","text":"Since one of the main goals of this project is to ensure that game developers can use the tool without requiring extensive knowledge in RL, the training manager is meant to further simplify the process of using the underlying ML-Agents Python package.
