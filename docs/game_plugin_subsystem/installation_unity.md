# Installing the Unity Package

To install the Unity Package, use the Unity Package Manager to install it from the GitHub repository https://github.com/realm-ai-project/GamePlugin-Subsystem.git:

1. Open your project in Unity, and then open the [Unity Package Manager](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/upm-ui.html){:target="_blank"}.

2. Click on the **add** (+) button, and select "Add package from git URL"

3. Enter "https://github.com/realm-ai-project/GamePlugin-Subsystem.git" into the URL field and click "Add".

Unity will download and install the package into your project. If these steps fail, please refer to Unity's documentation to resolve any errors. For example, there may be conflicts with the dependencies of this package with other packages in your projects, which can be manually resolved following the [Unity documentation on Package Conflicts](https://docs.unity3d.com/2019.1/Documentation/Manual/upm-conflicts.html){:target="_blank"}.

When the package is successfully installed and there are no code compilation errors, a "Realm AI" menu should appear in the menu bar.
