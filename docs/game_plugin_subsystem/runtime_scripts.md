# Runtime Scripts Breakdown

The REALM_AI Unity package heavily depends on the ML-Agents Unity package for its machine learning features. The ML-Agents Unity package is mainly composed of Unity scripts that are required for specifying the behaviour of the machine learning agent and establishing a connection with the Python machine learning environment when training the agent. The REALM_AI Unity package contains scripts that will perform the required setup for ML-Agents (in addition to doing it's own thing). For more information on ML-Agents, see its [official documentation](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/tree/main/docs){:target="_blank"}.

This subsection of the documentation is intended for readers with some knowledge of ML-Agents and users who want to understand and modify the scripts in the REALM_AI package.
